<p class="preFade fadeIn"><strong>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</strong></p>

<p class="preFade fadeIn"><strong>13. Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<p class="preFade fadeIn">13.1  <em>Arbitration.</em> You agree that all disputes between you and ARCHETYPE (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with ARCHETYPE, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms, your use of the Services or any Content, or any rights of privacy or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes, and you and ARCHETYPE hereby expressly waive trial by jury. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor ARCHETYPE will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if ARCHETYPE is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either ARCHETYPE or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the dispute resolution organization known as American Arbitration Association. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with these Terms. You and ARCHETYPE agree that all arbitration proceedings will be held in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, and will be held in English. This Section 13 will survive the termination of your use of the Services, and/or your relationship with ARCHETYPE.</p>
<p class="preFade fadeIn">13.2  <em>Time Limitation on Claims.</em> You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with ARCHETYPE must be filed within one (1) year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p class="preFade fadeIn">13.3  <em>Governing Law &amp; Venue.</em> These Terms and any actions related to these Terms shall be governed by, construed, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to any choice of law principle that would dictate the application of the law of another jurisdiction. In no event will the United Nations Conventions on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (to the extent otherwise applicable), be deemed to apply to these Terms. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms, or in the event that any of the arbitration or class action terms are determined to be invalid or unenforceable, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with ARCHETYPE exclusively in the state or federal courts sitting in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, and you hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. ARCHETYPE’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. ARCHETYPE reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but no such changes will apply to any disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with ARCHETYPE. YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THESE TERMS.</p>
<p class="preFade fadeIn">13.4  <em>Entire Agreement.</em> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and ARCHETYPE with respect to your access to and use of the Services, and supersede any prior understanding or agreement between you and ARCHETYPE with respect thereto. You will not assign these Terms, or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of ARCHETYPE. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the prior written consent of ARCHETYPE will be null and void. ARCHETYPE may assign these Terms or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms. These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p class="preFade fadeIn">13.5  <em>Territorial Restrictions.</em> The information provided within the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject ARCHETYPE to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Services to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service, or other feature that ARCHETYPE provides. Software related to or made available by the Services may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no software related to the Services may be downloaded, exported, or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Deny Orders. By downloading any software related to the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.</p>
<p class="preFade fadeIn">13.6  <em>Language.</em> These Terms were written in the English language. To the extent any translated version of these Terms conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.</p>
<p class="preFade fadeIn">13.7  <em>Notice.</em> You agree that any notices required to be given under this Agreement by ARCHETYPE will be deemed to have been given if delivered in accordance with the contact information you provided with respect to your Account.</p>
